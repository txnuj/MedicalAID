# What is Medicords?

Medicords is a health based web application. It is a website where hospitals can register and store records of their patients and even patients can view their prescription in a read only mode.


# Problem it solves:

Most of the hospitals in India have a local server to store records of the patients which prevents patients access to their medical records if they visit another hospital. So there is a need for a common system in which hospitals can store the medical records and patients are able to access their records so that the patient's previous record can be seen if the patient undergoes treatment in any other hospital. To achieve this goal, a website needs to be created where hospitals can register. When a patient visits a hospital, the hospital searches for the patient's profile, stores his records , if he doesn't have any profile , a new profile will be created for that patient on that website. Hospitals can edit only the records that they have stored. Patients can access their records on read mode only. They can add their previous records in their profile in pdf or document forms. When the patient visits another hospital, then the hospital can access their records by searching for his profile.This app is fault tolerant and can handle traffic.
